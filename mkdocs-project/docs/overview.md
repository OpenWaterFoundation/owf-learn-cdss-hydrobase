# CDSS HydroBase / Tables / Overview

HydroBase is a [relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database), which more specifically uses
the [Microsoft SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server) technology.

[Colorado Division of Water Resources](http://water.state.co.us) staff maintain several versions of HydroBase and related databases
necessary to do the work of State water agencies.  Examples of data maintained in these databases include:

* real-time streamflow data from the Satellite Monitoring System
* well permit applications
* water rights and diversion records
* HydroBase used by CDSS modelers

HydroBase data are accessible multiple ways as indicated below.
Various tools are useful, but can be overwhelming without an understanding of terminology, what to look for, and interpreting the data.
This documentation attempts to facilitate understanding HydroBase data so that the available HydroBase tools and datasets can be used more effectively.
In this context, a "dataset" is a table of related data, such as water rights and diversion structures.

## Online HydroBaes Resources

HydroBase provides data for the following online resources, including:

* [Interactive data displays on the CO DWR Data & Maps online tools](http://water.state.co.us/DataMaps/DataSearch/Pages/DataSearch.aspx).
* [HydroBase web services](http://water.state.co.us/DataMaps/WebServices/Pages/WebServices.aspx)
* Data feed for water datasets on the [Colorado Information Marketplace](data.colordo.gov)
* Export spatial data to the [CDSS Map Viewer](http://cdss.state.co.us/onlineTools/Pages/MapViewer.aspx)

The DWR online forms allow interactive searches.  The web services facilitate automated downloads and processing.
The Colorado Information Marketplace provides interactive searches and download capabilities, as well as some visualization tools.

## Downloading and Using HydroBase

HydroBase is also available for download, with archives maintained by the Open Water Foundation, to facilitate software development and CDSS modeling
(this is not the authoritative source of all HydroBase versions):

* [HydroBase Archive Download](https://sites.google.com/site/cdssstaging/hydrobase/download).

HydroBase can be downloaded, installed, and used with CDSS modeling tools.
